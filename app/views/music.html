        <span class="smallPrint">20:00 - 21:00</span>
        <p>Sleeping with the fishes have been working hard over the past years building a powerful repertoire of live and recorded songs. They broke into the festival circuit playing at Biker bashes and are now a regular fixture at festivals like Crosby
            in Liverpool and Wychwood in Cheltenham. This review from David Barnicle at ‘Good Vibrations magazine’ sums up what you can expect from them live.
            <br><br> Simply put, Sleeping with the Fishes are a marvelously cinematic, atmospheric and energy-filled live band. Such was the intensity from the off, the question, ‘Will this band ever come down?’ arose during song three. It did come down,
            eventually, however, in tempo only.. The intensity remained and for what they gave up in tempo, they more than made up for in depth, songmanship and emotion, which arguably results in a deeper impact on the listener. Sonically, its akin to
            Progs like Floyd and Genesis, having lunch with Arcade Fire and Feeder, while Billy Idol boozes.
